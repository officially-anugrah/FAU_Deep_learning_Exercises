## Exercise 1
### Overview
This folder contains the implementation of **Exercise 1** from my deep learning coursework. The exercise focuses on fundamental deep learning concepts, including forward and backward propagation, optimization techniques, and training simple neural networks.

### Objectives
- Implement a basic **fully connected neural network** from scratch.
- Understand **gradient descent** and how it updates model parameters.
- Train a model on a simple dataset and evaluate its performance.

### Implementation Details
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)
- **Key Components:**
  - Forward propagation
  - Loss computation
  - Backpropagation
  - Parameter updates using **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
